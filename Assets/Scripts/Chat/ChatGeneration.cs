/* BY: ALIN
this script has a function called GenerateMessage which returns one [1] string containing a thing that
our chat would be saying at this point in time, based on some numbers corresponding to what the player
is doing right now.

ideally GenerateMessage should be called at different speeds, faster for when the monster is around
and much slower when nothing is happening

        HOW THIS WORKS:
        so we have two chances in play rn, request & monster chance
        request chance is the chance the message will be a request message (ex: 0.20f)
        monster chance is the chance the message will be a scared message (ex: 0.30f)
        then we pick a number between 0 and 1.00f

        monsterchance has priority and requests have lower priority, so if monster chance is 1.0f, and request is 0.2f
        it'll always be a monster message

        so if the number is 
        under 0.20f, monster spook message
        under 0.20f+0.30f, we get a request
        if it's over 0.20f+0.30f, we get a regular random chat message
        */
